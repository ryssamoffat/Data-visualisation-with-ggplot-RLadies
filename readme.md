## Aims ##

Created for the Zurich R-Ladies group, this tutorial covers a number of visualisation tips and techniques using ggplot. The slides from the workshop can also provide some context.
The data supplied in this workflow are from my own research.

### Files ###

The There are three R Markdown files, starting easy and increasing in difficulty as you go.

#### Part1.Rmd ####

This part is for getting familiar with the aesthetics options available in ggplot, and feeling wild and free while designing exciting plots.

#### Part2.Rmd ####

This part has some practical examples of how to avoid redundancy and to maximise how much information a plot conveys.

#### Part3.Rmd ####

This part covers how to visualise multi-level model ouputs and any subsequent contrasts results. As a bonus, there's also an example of how we can create fancy 3D plot.
